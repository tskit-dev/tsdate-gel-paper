# Analysis performed on the Genomics England RE environment

This directory contains code for analysing mutation ages inferred for participants in the Genomics England Research Environment.
You can gain access to the research environment by following these steps: [GEL Research Environment](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/research).

## HTML reports
You can links to rendered HTML reports for each section here:

- [GEL, Summary statistics]
- [GEL, Allele ages and ancestral diversity]
- [GEL, Allele ages and negative selection]
- [GEL, Allele ages of clinically classified mutations]

There are also reports for generating annotated parquet dataframes from inferred ARGs (per chromosome).  
These are stored in the `chrom_reports/` subdirectory.
